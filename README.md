# IBM-Data-Science-Applied-Capstone

# Introduction
This Applied Capstone Project is the final course in the IBM Data Science Professional Certifiacte specialization on Coursera, where I will be applying all the data science skills learned throughout the course as a data scientist for a private space laucnh company.

# Background
In this capstone, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

# Questions To Be Answered
1. How variables such as payload mass, launch site, number of flights, orbits, affect the success of the first stage landing?
2. Does the rate of successful landings increase over the years?
3. What is the best predictive model for successful landing (binary classification)
